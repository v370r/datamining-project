MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS, INC.

        Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company as defined in Rule 12a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. With our participation, an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was conducted as of December 31, 2013, based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Controlâ€”Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013.  The Board of Directors and Stockholders
AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.:

        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013, the period August 31, 2012 to December 31, 2012, the 22-week period ended August 30, 2012, and the 52-week period ended March 29, 2012. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

        We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

        In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013, the August 31, 2012 to December 31, 2012 period, the 22-week period ended August 30, 2012, and the 52-week period ended March 29, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

        As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective August 30, 2012, the Company had a change of controlling ownership. As a result of this change of control, the consolidated financial information after August 30, 2012 is presented on a different cost basis than that for the period before the change of control and, therefore, is not comparable.
