Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in our revenue.
We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost.
For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours.
Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products.
Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost.
We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers\u2019 increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future.
Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available from third parties.
